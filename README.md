# SExCoD

SExCoD is a tool for converting between SEAnim/SEModel and XAnim/XModel from Call of Duty.

It currently supports:

* XMODEL_BIN/XMODEL_EXPORT to SEModel

With plans to further extend it with the other formats and going to and from each format.

# Using SExCoD

To start off, download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Scobalula/SExCoD/releases) section.

Then you can drag and drop files onto the exe to convert them.
